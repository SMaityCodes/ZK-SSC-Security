- number of material and products can be less than or equal to 5.
- expected materials and expected products are equal to 3
- require rule does not consume artifacts, it only validates
- create and disallow consumes artifacts.
- create is applicable only for products
- require and disallow are applicable to both artifacts (materials and product), but I've implemented disallow only for products
- disallow implementation is hardcoded to "DISALLOW *" functionality
