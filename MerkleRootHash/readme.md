-merkleroot.js takes IntFormat.json as input, an generates input.json as output.
-input.json has the calculated MerkleRoot.
-inut.json is given as input to merkleroot.circom. =====> no other input?
-In witness.json, if output is 1 the merkle root match , else they do not match.

plz modify the corcom program so that in witness.json file we can see the Merkle root (calculated by the circom program itself) as the output
